## Install the Matching Service Adapter

**Prerequisite:** The Matching Service Adapter (MSA) requires Java 8. Make sure you have the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

1. When you have successfully completed a gate review for [Stage 3: Planning](http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage3/Stage3.html), email [<idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>](mailto:idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to request access to the secure site where you can download the Matching Service Adapter.
1. Download the MSA zip file to your host. It contains:
    * a jar (java archive) file
    * [truststore](#glossary-truststore) files for non-production environments (the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment) - `test_ida_hub.ts` and `test_ida_metadata.ts`
 * truststore files for the production environment - `prod_ida_hub.ts` and `prod_ida_metadata.ts`
 * a sample YAML configuration file for non-production environments  - `test-config.yml`
 * a sample YAML configuration file for the production environment  - `prod-config.yml`


1. To extract the files, run the following command:

        unzip ida-msa-[MSA build number].zip

1. Optionally, move the truststore files to the environment where you want to use the MSA:

        mv prod_ida_hub.ts prod_ida_metadata.ts [path to truststore directory in the production environment]
        mv test_ida_hub.ts test_ida_metadata.ts [path to truststore directory in the integration environment]


    where `[path to truststore directory...]` is the location of the truststore – you specify this when configuring the MSA (see the  `trustStore:` fields in the [YAML file](#yaml-configuration-file)).

### Versioning

Typically, GOV.UK Verify releases a new version of the MSA every 2 or 3 months. Some releases are essential updates and we
may remove support for older versions. To keep updated, contact the
[GOV.UK Verify support
team](mailto:idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to
ensure you are on the Matching Service Adapter email distribution list.

## Obtain certificates for your Matching Service Adapter

Your MSA needs a signing certificate and an
encryption certificate. You must use different certificates for each
environment.

To obtain certificates:

* [generate self-signed certificates](#generate-self-signed-certificates) for use with the compliance tool
* [request certificates](#request-certificates) from the IDAP certificate authority for the integration and production environments

## Configure the Matching Service Adapter

### Create a YAML configuration file

When you [start the MSA](#start-the-matching-service-adapter), you need
to supply a YAML configuration file.

The MSA zip file contains two sample YAML configuration files:

* `test-config.yml` for the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment
* `prod-config.yml` for the production environment 


<a name="yaml-configuration-file"></a>

[Adapt the YAML configuration file](#adapt-the-yaml-configuration-file) where required. Below is the `test-config.yml` file:


    # Configure the matching service adapter's server settings here.
    # See http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.5/docs/manual/configuration.html#servers

### Adapt the YAML configuration file

Make the following changes to the YAML configuration file according to the environment where you want to use the MSA. Variations are indicated for the SAML compliance tool and integration and production environments.


#### In the field `server:`

1. Enter port numbers for the server application (`applicationConnectors`) and admin ports (`adminConnectors`).

   > **Note:** If the MSA will be handling SSL termination (typically this will be handled by a proxy or load balancer like HAProxy), or if you don't trust the network between the SSL termination endpoint and the MSA, then specify `https` rather than `http` for the type of connection. For more information, see the guidance in the [DropWizard configuration manual](<http://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/1.0.5/docs/manual/configuration.html#https>).


#### In the field `matchingServiceAdapter:`


1. Enter the [entityID](#glossary-entityID) for the MSA in `entityId`. This should reflect the name of your service, for example `https://<service name>/MSA`

   > **Note:** It's good practice to use the MSA's URI (where the hub will send matching requests) as its entityID, but this isn't mandatory.


3. Enter the URI for your MSA in `externalUrl:`

#### In the field `localMatchingService:`

4. Enter the URI for your local matching service in `matchUrl:`

5. If you're creating new user accounts when a match isn't found (see [create user accounts](#create-user-accounts)), enter the user account creation URI in `accountCreationUrl:`

#### In the field `signingKeys:`

6. Enter the paths of the primary SAML signing keys and certificates for your MSA in `primary:`
   * for the compliance tool, [generate self-signed certificates](#generate-self-signed-certificates)
   * you'll use different keys and certificates for the integration and production environments - see [Request certificates](#request-certificates).

   > **Note:** To convert a private key to PKCS#8 DER format, run the following command: `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in server.key -out server.pk8 -outform DER`


#### In the field `encryptionKeys:`

7. Enter the paths and names of the encryption keys and certificates for your MSA in `encryptionKeys`.  The names are used to identify the certificates in the metadata so should be meaningful and unique, for example, `signing_1` and `encryption_1`.

#### In the field `hub:`

8. In `trustStore:` `path:` , specify the path to your hub truststore file for the appropriate environment:
  * for the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment, use the provided `test_ida_hub.ts` file (this is the default setting in the `test-config.yml` file)
  * for the production environment, use the provided `prod_ida_hub.ts` file (this is the default setting in the `prod-config.yml` file)

#### In the field `metadata:`

9. Edit the `url:` value and specify the location where the MSA accesses the SAML metadata:
  * for the SAML compliance tool, use the default setting in the `test-config.yml` file
  * for the integration environment, enter: `https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/federation` in the `test-config.yml` file
  * for the production environment, use the default setting in the `prod-config.yml` file

10. In `trustStore:` `path:`, specify the path to your metadata truststore file for the appropriate environment:
  * for the SAML compliance tool and the integration environment, use the provided `test_ida_metadata.ts` file (this is the default setting in the `test-config.yml` file)
  * for the production environment, use the provided `prod_ida_metadata.ts` file (this is the default setting in the `prod-config.yml` file)


## Start the Matching Service Adapter

To start using the MSA, run the following command,
supplying the path to your configuration file:

    java -jar [filename].jar server [path to configuration file].yml

You can now run
[SAML compliance tests between the hub and your Matching Service Adapter](#test-your-matching-service-with-the-saml-compliance-tool).
To help [build your local matching service](#build-a-local-matching-service), you can use the
[example of the JSON request](#example-of-a-json-request-to-your-local-matching-service) that the Matching Service
Adapter posts to your service.

## Monitoring

Health checks run every 60 seconds to ensure that the Matching Service
Adapter is functioning correctly. They test:

* connectivity
* that the Matching Service Adapter accepts the hub signature
* that the hub accepts the Matching Service Adapter signature

## Configure HTTPS Proxies

The Matching Service Adapter supports HTTP and HTTPS proxies configured
by Java properties.

For information on configuring HTTPS proxies, see
[<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html>](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html).

## Secure your Matching Service Adapter

### Matching Service Adapter TLS certificates

GOV.UK Verify trusts the following root certificate authorities for
HTTPS connections to your matching service:

|Root certificate authority |Common name |X509v3 subject key identifier |
|:---|:---|:---|
|AddTrust External CA Root |AddTrust External CA Root |AD:BD:98:7A:34:B4:26:F7:FA:C4:26:54:EF:03:BD:E0:24:CB:54:1A |
|GeoTrust Global CA |GeoTrust Global CA |C0:7A:98:68:8D:89:FB:AB:05:64:0C:11:7D:AA:7D:65:B8:CA:CC:4E |
|QuoVadis Root CA 2 | QuoVadis Root CA 2 |1A:84:62:BC:48:4C:33:25:04:D4:EE:D0:F6:03:C4:19:46:D1:94:6B|

If you want to use a root certificate authority for your matching
service that isn’t in the above table, raise a ticket with us by sending
an email to <idasupport+onboarding@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>. We’ll
review your chosen root certificate authority before adding it to this
list.

When you raise a ticket, indicate the chain of trust with your SSL/TLS
certificate. You will also need the chain of trust when you configure
your server.

### Connect your Matching Service Adapter to the internet securely

Your Matching Service Adapter must only respond to matching requests
from the GOV.UK Verify hub, otherwise there’s a risk of user data being
compromised.

The Matching Service Adapter checks that matching service requests are
genuine by checking their cryptographic signatures.

To ensure that only the GOV.UK Verify hub can access the Matching
Service Adapter, make sure your Matching Service Adapter:

* is only exposed as HTTPS endpoints
* only uses strong recent versions of TLS (for example TLS 1.2); turn off obsolete and insecure versions (for example SSLv1, SSLv2, and SSLv3)
* supports multiple strong cipher suites

  > **Note:** GOV.UK Verify will remove support for TLS cipher suites if serious
  > weaknesses become known. Having multiple suites provides
  > resilience.

* allows requests and health checks only from the IP addresses of hub services provided by your engagement lead

  > **Note:** Each Matching Service Adapter should communicate with only 1 hub
  > service (SAML compliance tool, integration environment, or production environment).
